Nelle's thesis project involves studying the effects of a gene called GGL which appears to play a large role in addiction to the internet. To evaluate the gene's function he is comparing two different groups of mice; one set of mice with a normal GGL gene (wildtype) and one set in which the GGL gene is turned off (knockout). Within each set of mouse he is also looking specifically at two cell types (A and B). He sends the samples to a sequencing facility and is returned a rather large data matrix. Everytime he opens it in Excel, his laptop freezes. Afetr much frustration he decides to use R to analyze the data.
