## What is R?

R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language important tool for computational statistics, visualization and data science. Inspired by the programming language S.

* Open source software under GPL
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 7,000 user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and industry
* Available on all platforms
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming
* Is object oriented and functional
* Large and growing community of peers


## The Big Data problem
Your major thesis project involves studying the effects of a gene called `GGL` which appears to play a large role in addiction to the internet. To evaluate the gene's function you are comparing two different groups of mice; one set of mice with a normal GGL gene (wildtype) and one set in which the `GGL` gene is turned off (knockout). Within each set of mice you are also asked to evaluate two different cell types (A and B). The samples are sent to a sequencing facility and rather large data matrices are returned to you. Everytime you open it in Excel, your laptop freezes and crashes. **After much frustration you decide to use R to analyze the data.**
